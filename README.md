## About the Book

"The Anatomy of Go" takes you on a journey through the inner workings of the Go programming language. This book is designed for intermediate to advanced Go developers who want to understand how the language operates under the hood. By exploring Go's internals from the ground up, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the language's design choices and implementation details.

Unlike typical Go books that focus on syntax and best practices, this book peels back the layers to examine how Go actually works - from basic data types to memory management, compilation to concurrency. Each chapter systematically builds your understanding of the language's architecture and mechanics.

## Contents

The book covers eight comprehensive chapters:

1. **Go Thinks Simple Works Better** - Explores Go's design philosophy and the reasoning behind its minimalist approach
2. **Basic Data Types, Variables, and Constants** - Dives into how Go implements its fundamental types
3. **Arrays, Slices, Strings, and Maps** - Examines the internal structure of Go's core data structures
4. **Structs, Interfaces and Generics** - Uncovers how Go implements object-oriented features and type parameterization
5. **How Go Code Turns Into Assembly** - Walks through the compilation process from source code to executable
6. **Functionality** - Explores function implementation, closures, defer, panic, and other core features
7. **Memory** - Investigates memory management, garbage collection, and escape analysis
8. **Concurrency** - Reveals the inner workings of goroutines, channels, and Go's concurrency patterns

## Who This Book Is For

This book is ideal for:

- Go developers who want to deepen their understanding of the language
- Systems programmers interested in how Go implements its features
- Anyone curious about language design and implementation
- Developers looking to write more efficient Go code through understanding its internals

While some familiarity with Go is expected, the book progressively builds knowledge from simpler concepts to more complex ones. If you're new to Go, consider completing the [Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour/) before diving in.

## About the Author

Phuong Le is a Go developer and writer working at VictoriaMetrics, where he contributes to high-performance observability solutions built in Go. An active member of the Gopher community, Phuong has spent years exploring Go's internals and sharing his knowledge. This book emerged from his passion for understanding how Go works at a fundamental level.

The book was created in collaboration with Matt Boyle, founder of bytesizego.com, with the goal of creating an in-depth resource that helps Go engineers take their skills to the next level.

## Technical Details

- The book primarily covers Go 1.23 for ARM64
- Examples and explanations are designed to be clear and accessible
- Complex concepts are broken down with diagrams and practical code examples
- Focus is on understanding core concepts rather than edge cases
